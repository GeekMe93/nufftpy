# NUFFT in Python

This repository holds experiments with pure-python implementations of the NUFFT and related algorithms.
For more information see the [NUFFT page](http://www.cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/nufft/nufft.html), and also see the [python-nufft](https://github.com/dfm/python-nufft) package which provides simple Python wrappers for the nufft Fortran source.
