      "# Optimizing Python with NumPy and Numba\n",
      "\n",
      "When I come across a fast implementation of a useful numerical algorithm, I find it extremely useful for my own understanding of the algorithm to attempt to re-implement it in Python.\n",
      "If the original implementation is in some compiled language like Fortran or C, the result can be orders-of-magnitude slower.\n",
      "But I've found that with a bit of thought and careful use of available tools, it's often possible to make pure-Python implementations whose speed rivals that of compiled codes.\n",
      "This is nice for a couple reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Python implementations are often higher-level than C and Fortran, and is thus generally easier to read, understand, and tweak.\n",
      "- Pure-python packages are much easier to install than Python-wrapped C or Fortran code, especially on non-Linux systems. Fortran in particular can require some installation steps that are not trivial for beginning coders.\n",
      "- Because it does not require complicated installation, when running code at scale on shared clusters, pure Python code is generally much easier to use than compiled extensions.\n",
      "\n",
      "This post outlines the process of understanding, implementing, and optimizing an algorithm in Python, in the case of the Non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT).\n",
      "Along the way, we'll see how a quick & easy pure Python implementation, with a little help from Numba, can come within a factor of two of a highly-optimized Fortran implementation of this particular algorithm."

      "One important limitation of the FFT is that it requires that input data be evenly-spaced: that is, we can think of the values $y_n$ as samples of a function $y_n = y(x_n)$ where $x_n = x_0 + n\\Delta x$ is a regular grid of points.\n",
      "But what about when your grid is not uniform?\n",
      "That is, what if you want to compute this result:\n",
