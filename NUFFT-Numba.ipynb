      "Donald Knuth famously quipped that \"premature optimization is the root of all evil.\"\n",
      "The reasons are straightforward: optimized code tends to be much more difficult to read and debug than simpler implementations of the same algorithm, and optimizing too early leads to greater costs down the road.\n",
      "In the Python world, there is another cost to optimization: optimized code often is written in a compiled language like Fortran or C, and this leads to barriers to its development, use, and deployment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've found in my research and teaching that pure-Python implementations of algorithms are far more valuable than C or Fortran implementations, even if they might be a bit slower.\n",
      "This is for a number of reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pure-Python code is easier to read, understand, and contribute to.** Good Python implementations are much higher-level than C or Fortran, and abstract-away loop indices, bit twiddling,  workspace arrays, and other sources of code clutter. A typical student reading good Python code can immediately understand and modify the algorithm, while the same student would be lost trying to understand typical optimized Fortran code.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pure-python packages are much easier to install than Python-wrapped C or Fortran code.** This is especially true on non-Linux systems. Fortran in particular can require some installation prerequisites that are non-trivial for many users. In practice, I've seen people give up on better tools when there is an installation barrier for those tools.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pure-python code often works for many data types.** Because of the way it is written, pure Python code is often automatically applicable to single or double precision, and perhaps even to extensions to complex numbers. For compiled packages, supporting and compiling for all possible types can be a burden.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Pure-python is easier to use at scale.** Because it does not require complicated installation, pure Python packages can be much easier to install on cloud VMs and/or shared clusters for computation at scale. If you can easily pip-install a pure-Python package on a VM, then services like AWS and TravisCI are much easier to set up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Certainly code speed will overcome these considerations if the performance gap is great enough, but I've found that for many applications a pure Python package, cleverly designed and optimized, can be made fast enough that these larger considerations win-out. The challenge is making the Python fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Too often, tutorials about optimizing Python use trivial or toy examples which may not map well to the real world.\n",
      "I've certainly been [guilty](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2012/08/24/numba-vs-cython/) of this [myself](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/06/15/numba-vs-cython-take-2/).\n",
      "Here, I'm going to take a different route: in this post I will outline the process of understanding, implementing, and optimizing a non-trivial algorithm in Python, in the case of the [Non-uniform Fast Fourier Transform](http://www.cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/nufft/nufft.html) (NUFFT).\n",
      "Along the way, we'll dig into the process of optimizing Python code, and see how a relatively straightforward pure Python implementation, with a little help from Numba, can be made to nearly match the performance of a highly-optimized Fortran implementation of the same algorithm."

      "$$\n",
      "You can read more about the FFT in [my previous post](https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2013/08/28/understanding-the-fft/) on the subject.\n",
      "\n",
      "One important limitation of the FFT is that it requires that input data be evenly-spaced: that is, we can think of the values $y_n$ as samples of a function $y_n = y(x_n)$ where $x_n = x_0 + n\\Delta x$ is a regular grid of points.\n",
      "But what about when your grid is not uniform?\n",
      "That is, what if you want to compute this result:\n",
      "$$\n",
      "Y_k^\\pm = \\sum_{j=1}^N y(x_j) e^{\\pm i k x_j}\n",
      "$$\n",
      "where $y(x)$ is evaluated at an arbitrary set of points $x_j$?\n",
      "In this case, the FFT is no longer directly applicable, and you're stuck using a much slower $O[N^2]$ direct summation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stuck, that is, until the NUFFT came along.\n",
      "\n",
      "The NUFFT is a clever algorithm which converts the non-uniform transform into an approximate uniform transform, not with error-prone interpolation, but instead using a clever \"gridding\" operation motivated by the convolution theorem.\n",
      "If you'd like to read about the algorithm in detail, the Courant Institute's [NUFFT page](http://www.cims.nyu.edu/cmcl/nufft/nufft.html) has a nice set of resources.\n",
